**Who invented the beet emoji?**

The beet emoji was dreamed up by Thomas Woodside. But he didn't actually draw the emoji -- that was his friend, Nicholas
Beninato. This might get ugly if Beetss is ever a billion dollar company.

**I don't see a beet emoji on my phone?**

That's because it hasn't been approved yet. The question above was written in light of the inevitability of its approval.

**So...why does this site exist?**

Somebody sent me a photo of a Quiplash prompt that said "an FAQ question on www.beets.com". Well, here it is. An FAQ
question. On www.beetss.com.

**Is this really a valuable use of your time?**

Maybe. It might not have a high probability of success, but think about the expected value. Value of what, exactly? We can figure that part out later.

**Why beets?**

Did you know that some questions don't have answers?

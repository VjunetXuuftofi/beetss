    <b>You should eat beets.</b> If you have never had them before, I am sorry. Use my tried and true recipe:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Preheat oven to 400F.
    </li>
    <li>
        Chop your beets into small pieces, maybe one square inch and 1/3 an inch thick. You don't need to peel them. Dirt is good for you.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place your beets on a sheet pan. Grind some salt and pepper onto them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour olive oil onto the beets in the sheet pan. Use your hands to massage the beets so that all the oil and salt/pepper
        surrounds them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place in the oven for 40 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enjoy!
    </li>
</ol>
